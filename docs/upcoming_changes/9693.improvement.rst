Fixed ``typed.List __repr__()`` to display ellipsis appropriately.
------------------------------------------------------------------

``typed.List __repr__()`` has been fixed to display the list elements
without appending the ellipsis at the end, up until a maximum of 1000 elements.
Previously, the list repr would append the ellipsis at the end of the list
regardless of the number of elements in the list.
