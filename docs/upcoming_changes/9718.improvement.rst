``find_topo_sort`` reliablilty improvement
--------------------------------------

Improves the reliability of the ``find_topo_sort`` function for complex CFGs
(typically through generated code) by replacing the recursive post order traversal
with an iterative one. This removes a risk of hitting the Python recursion limit.
